Hello 👋 My name is Tim, I've been developing for Apple platforms sisdasdnce 2011! 

I'm incredibly passionate about building applications that put the user experience first - details matter! Interested in securing mobile applications, user data and respecting user privacy.

Currently working on:

- 🔨 Building [Altilium](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/altilium/id1560227798) - an iOS application written predominantly in SwiftUI that helps cardiac physiologists optimise the energy outputs of batteries in pacemakers
- 👾 Maintaining [emul8080r](https://github.com/timsearle/emul8080r) - an Intel 8080 emulator written in Swift

Older projects:

- [Euclid](https://github.com/timsearle/euclid) - Great-circle mathematics helper library for working easily with Core Location
- [Bind](https://github.com/karmarama/bind) - A lightweight implementation of reactive type that you can subscribe to and transform values in a simple stream. An extremely simple way to introduce new engineers to functional reactive programming.

🧗🏻‍♂️If I'm not writing code, I'm rock climbing! Can often be found lurking around London's many climbing walls.
