I'm Tim, a software engineer based in London. I've been building software professionally since 2009.

## Focus

I build applications that put the user experience first. Details matter. My current interests include zero-trust systems, mobile application security, and user privacy.

## Current Work

**Principal Software Engineer** at Marks & Spencer, where I lead authentication APIs for Identity and Access Management and help build out our Developer Platform with a focus on native mobile engineering.

**Altilium** — an iOS application written in SwiftUI that helps cardiac physiologists optimise the energy outputs of batteries in pacemakers.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not writing software, I'm rock climbing. Qualified Mountain Training Rock Climbing Instructor, often found at London's climbing walls or instructing at the Southern Sandstone.
