Back in 2016, I was interviewed at WWDC about the latest iOS release, and my comments on Siri App integrations were listed under a heading - the ["death of apps"](https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/apple-breaks-down-walled-garden-opening-siri-maps-developers/1398495#:~:text=The%20death%20of%20apps&text=Citing%20specific%20Apple%20iOS%20features,no%20longer%20by%20specific%20downloads.%22). 

Despite the interviewer taking slight journalistic liberties with my thoughts, I do think my general intent behind the words was actually captured quite well. 

In a recent [interview with Peter Steinberger](https://lexfridman.com/peter-steinberger-transcript#chapter18_ai_agents_will_replace_80_of_apps), the creator of AI assistant, [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai), he stated that 80% of apps will disappear because AI assistant will be able to handle the majority of features that users expect of their app. This statement was a real déjà vu moment, reminding me of my own comments back in 2016.

Did my prediction come true? No. Siri still can’t do it. But OpenClaw can.

Do I think an open-source tool will go mainstream and fulfil this goal? No. The same way decentralised crypto didn’t take off until companies centralised it and _made it_ adoptable. But will the big tech incumbents land something that does tap in to the average user and provide a launch pad for automations into their current apps? Almost certainly.
