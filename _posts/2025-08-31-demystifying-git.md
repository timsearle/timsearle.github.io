This time last year, I gave a presentation internally at M&S, for our engineering community, called “Demystifying Git.” Rather than the usual how-to guide, I wanted people to walk away with a clearer picture of how Git actually works — and how that understanding can make it easier to use and to debug the awkward states repositories sometimes get into.

The session went down well, but I recently realised the slides have just been sitting idle on my laptop ever since. So, here they are! Take a look, and let me know if you learned something new - or if you’ve got something to add or correct.
